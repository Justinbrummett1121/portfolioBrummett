        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Justin Brummett and I am currently enrolled at 1150 academy in the web development program. I am hoping to break into the ever-growing tech industry after completing the program at 1150. I am also a licensed Bail Agent for the state of Indiana. I have learned a lot thus far about html and css as well as starting to really break into javascript and the endless possibilities it provides. Below you will find some of the projects I have worked on so far in my time at 1150 Academy. A little further below that you find some contact info to reach out to me if you would like and I would love to work with you in the future! Thank you for visiting and have a great day!</p>
